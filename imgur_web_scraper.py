"""
This module goes to imgur.com, and downloads the first N galleries (up to 60) of a certain imgur search based on
user input.

Usage: python3 imgur_web_scraper.py

User will be asked to enter their desired search query. They will then be asked how many galleries they would
like to download. The program will then start Firefox and begin downloading the galleries. Each gallery is
saved in its own folder. These folders are place in a main gallery folder that's created in the program's
current directory.

Warning: The folder holding all of the galleries will replace any existing folders with the same name. The
new gallery folder will have a name of the form: search_tags_galleries (where 'search_tag' is the user's input).

Note 1: The requests.get() function will not load any javasript on a web page. This can lead to the loaded
page being different from what you're seeing in your browser window. Therefore, selenium is more useful for
downloading the galleries.

Note 2: In Imgur, gif animations are actually mp4 files. This is why an mp4 file is downloaded instead of
a gif.
